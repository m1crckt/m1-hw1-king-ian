## About Me
My name is Ian King and I currently reside in Tampa, FL where I was born and raised. I graduated from the University of Florida in 2022 with a bachelor of arts in Digital Arts & Sciences. At the moment, I work remotely as a digital content specialist (or, web producer) at Environmental Defense Fund. I enjoy running, watching movies, reading books, and making music in my free time!
## Past Coding Experience
I gained minor coding experience in my bachelors degree but chose to focus more on user interface design (or, visual design) during my time at UF. I can find my way around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I would consider myself a novice at best. I'm much more comfortable with HTML and CSS; JavaScript has always been the most challenging for me. Web design has been a key facet of both of the jobs I've had after graduating and I have (just barely) been able to pull my weight as a programmer; I keep things simple.
## Career Goals
1. Reach a senior/manager position at my current job (Environmental Defense Fund)
2. Become a Director of Marketing, Director of Digital Media, or Product Manager at my organization or another company.
3. Start my own organization or company.
